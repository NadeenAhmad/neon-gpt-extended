# From GPT to Mistral: Cross-Domain Ontology Learning with NeOn-GPT

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating ontology engineering tasks, yet existing approaches often focus on isolated knowledge extraction rather than full ontology construction. In this paper, we present an extended version of NeOn-GPT, a pipeline that integrates prompt-engineered LLM interactions within the structured NeOn ontology engineering methodology. Building on our prior work, we enhance the pipeline with improved prompting strategies, support for ontology reuse, and more robust validation mechanisms. We apply the updated pipeline across four domains—wine, sewer networks, cheminformatics, and environmental microbiology—using both proprietary (GPT-4o) and open-source (Mistral) LLMs to evaluate model and domain generalization. The resulting ontologies are assessed against expert-curated gold standards using structural, lexical, and semantic metrics. Our results highlight domain-specific strengths and limitations of different LLMs, revealing that while models can capture relevant concepts and properties (relations), challenges remain in lexical alignment, hierarchy depth, and semantic precision. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM-based ontology generation and offers practical insights for improving the quality and scalability of ontology learning pipelines.
